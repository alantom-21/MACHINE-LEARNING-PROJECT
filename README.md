# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT
# 1. Linear Regression
Explanation:
In this project, I implemented a Linear Regression model to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. I used a dataset that had a linear relationship, and the model learned this pattern by minimizing the error between predicted and actual values. I visualized the best-fit line to understand how well the model captured the trend. This helped me understand the basics of regression, model fitting, and evaluating model accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

What I learned:

* How to fit a regression line

* How to interpret coefficients

* Evaluating performance using error metrics

# 2. Polynomial Regression
Explanation:
This project builds upon linear regression by introducing polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships. I transformed the original features into higher-degree polynomial terms to fit curves instead of straight lines. By trying different degrees (like 2, 3, or 4), I learned how increasing model complexity can improve fitâ€”but also risk overfitting the data.

What I learned:

* Modeling non-linear data

* The bias-variance tradeoff

* When a model becomes too complex

# 3. Logistic Regression
Explanation:
I used Logistic Regression to classify data into two categories (binary classification). Unlike linear regression, this model outputs probabilities and uses a sigmoid function to map predictions between 0 and 1. I evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score. This project helped me understand classification problems and how to interpret precision, recall, and F1-score.

What I learned:

* Classification vs regression

* Using logistic regression for binary output

* Evaluating classification models

# 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Explanation:
In this project, I applied the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors. I tested the model using different values of k to find the optimal number of neighbors. I also normalized the data to ensure distance calculations were accurate. It gave me insight into how simple yet powerful KNN is for pattern recognition.

What I learned:

* How instance-based learning works

* Importance of scaling data

* Effect of k value on model accuracy

# 5. Decision Tree Classifier
Explanation:
Here, I used a Decision Tree to build a model that makes predictions by splitting data based on feature values. The tree makes decisions at each node, and the final decision is made at a leaf node. I visualized the tree to understand the decision path and learned how tree depth and pruning help prevent overfitting.

What I learned:

* How decision trees split data

* Gini Index and Entropy

* Visual interpretation of decisions

# 6. Random Forest Classifier
Explanation:
This project involves building a Random Forest, which is an ensemble of decision trees. Instead of relying on a single tree, the model makes predictions based on the majority vote from many trees, increasing accuracy and reducing overfitting. I also analyzed which features were most important in the prediction process.

What I learned:

* The power of ensemble methods

* Why random forests are more stable than individual trees

* Feature importance analysis
